# Sound Effects for Futuristic Minting Animation

Add the following sound files to this directory for the full minting animation experience:

1. `door-close.mp3` - Played when doors are closing
2. `minting-hum.mp3` - Played during the minting process (looping)
3. `complete.mp3` - Played when minting is complete
4. `door-open.mp3` - Played when doors are opening
5. `reveal.mp3` - Played during certificate reveal

You can find royalty-free sound effects on websites such as:
- Freesound (https://freesound.org/)
- Pixabay Sounds (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)
- Zapsplat (https://www.zapsplat.com/)

If no sound files are found, the animation will still work but without audio feedback.
